This squid is a baby about one foot long.\n\nA colossal squid was filmed for the first time in its natural habitat near the South Sandwich Islands during a recent expedition, and it turned out to be a baby\n\nA faintly fluttering specter, at first hardly visible among bits of marine snow falling in slow motion, emerged from the deep-sapphire void. The pilot of the underwater robot brought the creature to the center of the frame, giving scientists on a ship at the ocean\u2019s surface a good view of the strange life-form. Its mostly transparent, speckled dome was topped with fins that busily flapped like tiny wings, and its tentacles were drawn up underneath it, toward its glowing red undercarriage.\n\nThere was little fanfare\u2014just a few minutes of quiet, almost reverent observation. But the encounter, 100 years in the making, marked the first time a colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) had ever been caught on film in its natural habitat.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the planet\u2019s true giants, living in one of our most pristine marine ecosystems,\u201d says Kat Bolstad, an associate professor at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, who helped independently identify the creature from the footage. \u201cIt\u2019s a source of fascination and wonder, and it also plays a huge role in Antarctic food webs.\u201d\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

These leviathans can grow to about 23 feet long and can weigh more than 1,000 pounds\u2014shorter, but much stockier, than the giant squid (Architeuthis dux), which grows to about 43 feet long and 600 pounds. The colossal squid that was captured on film was just a baby, however, measuring only about a foot in length.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that we can leverage the power of the taxonomic community through R/V Falkor (too) telepresence while we are out at sea,\u201d said the expedition\u2019s chief scientist, Michelle Taylor of the University of Essex in England, in a recent press release. \u201cThe Ocean Census international science network is proud to work together with the Schmidt Ocean Institute to accelerate species discovery and expand our knowledge of ocean life, live online with the world\u2019s science community.\u201d\n\nThough people have known about the existence of colossal squids for a century, the animals had mainly been found among the stomach contents of whales and seabirds, successfully evading human eyes in their natural habitat.\n\n\u201cMuch of our scientific and filming gear is noisy and bright, so squid will be aware of our equipment long before we know they\u2019re there\u2014and they will stay well away,\u201d Bolstad says. \u201cThe deep sea is a vast 3D space, and looking for specific animals there is tricky, especially when they are probably actively trying to avoid us!\u201d Scientists still don\u2019t know much about what these reticent creatures feed on, how long they live or what their reproductive traits are.\n\nThe sighting came alongside many other strange encounters, including a grenadier fish with parasitic pigtails, a pi\u00f1atalike anemone, a carnivorous sponge that resembled a dandelion and Seussian corals. In a region so remote and underexplored, it\u2019s no surprise that weird and wonderful discoveries emerge\u2014and each new find offers valuable insight into a world that science is still just beginning to understand.\n\n\u201cObserving the colossal squid gives us the chance both to learn about this remote place,\u201d Bolstad says, \u201cand to share the excitement of such discoveries with people who may not think about the deep sea very often\u2014even though it makes up 95 percent of the living space on Earth and plays an enormous role in regulating our climate.\u201d", "image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/44c7363cb7362942/original/colossal-squid-baby.jpg?m=1744747529.868&w=1200", "images": ["https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/44c7363cb7362942/original/colossal-squid-baby.jpg?m=1744747529.868&w=1200", "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/44c7363cb7362942/original/colossal-squid-baby.jpg?m=1744747529.868&w=600"], "authors": ["Ashley Balzer Vigil", "Andrea Thompson"]}, {"title": "Google adds Veo 2 video generation to Gemini app", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/googles-veo-2-generative-video-creator-is-coming-to-gemini/", "source": "Ars Technica", "category": "technology", "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:43:28 +0000", "summary": "Video generation starts rolling out today for Gemini Advanced subscribers.", "full_content": "", "text": "Google has announced that yet another AI model is coming to Gemini, but this time, it's more than a chatbot.

Veo 2 is currently limited to 8 seconds of 720p video, which you can download as a standard MP4 file.

And Harvard-affiliated hospitals could bear the brunt of these effects. Nevertheless, Harvard\u2019s pushback has garnered widespread praise from faculty members, scientists and public figures, including former president Barack Obama.\n\nHow Scientists Are Reacting\n\nSome Harvard scientists expressed enthusiastic support for the institution\u2019s response. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for a major university to take a stand like this. I am thrilled that mine did,\u201d wrote Jeremy Faust, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, in his newsletter Inside Medicine.\n\nWhen Scientific American reached out to Faust for comment, he said he couldn\u2019t speak for Harvard. \u201cWhat I can say on behalf of myself is that I had been seriously considering submitting my first federal grant proposals until November [2024]. After the election, I abandoned those plans,\u201d he says. \u201cAny thought of soldering on was quickly put aside in January and February, when we witnessed the unprecedented viewpoint-driven censorship across [the Department of Health and Human Services], with certain disfavored views being literally punished with the sudden pulling of promised grant funding along ideological lines.\u201d\n\nOther Harvard scientists also praised the university\u2019s recent actions. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t speak for the community, but I suspect that a lot of my colleagues are quite excited that Harvard has a spine,\u201d said George Church, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, who leads synthetic biology at the Wyss Institute, to STAT.\n\nScientists at other institutions chimed in with support on social media. \u201cFirst time you\u2019ll hear this Yalie say: let\u2019s go Harvard. Seriously: Yale stand up and lead,\u201d wrote Gregg Gonsalves, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, in a post on Bluesky. Gonsalves was among about 900 faculty members who signed a letter to Yale\u2019s president that called on the school to defend academic freedom.\n\nStanford University\u2019s president and provost also issued a statement in support of Harvard\u2019s actions. \u201cHarvard\u2019s objections to the letter it received are rooted in the American tradition of liberty, a tradition essential to our country\u2019s universities, and worth defending,\u201d read the statement, which was published in the Stanford Daily. \u201cAmerica\u2019s universities are a source of great national strength, creating knowledge and driving innovation and economic growth,\u201d it continued. \u201cThis strength has been built on government investment but not government control.\u201d", "image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7fe74b139fd98df3/original/Harvard_Gates_2.jpg?m=1744744948.082&w=1200", "images": ["https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7fe74b139fd98df3/original/Harvard_Gates_2.jpg?m=1744744948.082&w=600", "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7fe74b139fd98df3/original/Harvard_Gates_2.jpg?m=1744744948.082&w=1200"], "authors": ["Tanya Lewis", "Dean Visser"]}, {"title": "The physics of bowling strike after strike", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/the-physics-of-bowling-strike-after-strike/", "source": "Ars Technica", "category": "technology", "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 19:00:56 +0000", "summary": "New model uses 6 differential equations relating to a rotating rigid body for best strike conditions.", "full_content": "", "text": "More than 45 million people in the US are fans of bowling, with national competitions awarding millions of dollars. Bowlers usually rely on instinct and experience, earned through lots and lots of practice, to boost their strike percentage. A team of physicists has come up with a mathematical model to better predict ball trajectories, outlined in a new paper published in the journal AIP Advances. The resulting equations take into account such factors as the composition and resulting pattern of the oil used on bowling lanes, as well as the inevitable asymmetries of bowling balls and player variability.\n\nThe authors already had a strong interest in bowling. Three are regular bowlers and quite skilled at the sport; a fourth, Curtis Hooper of Longborough University in the UK, is a coach for Team England at the European Youth Championships. Hooper has been studying the physics of bowling for several years, including an analysis of the 2017 Weber Cup, as well as papers devising mathematical models for the application of lane conditioners and oil patterns in bowling.\n\nThe calculations involved in such research are very complicated because there are so many variables that can affect a ball's trajectory after being thrown. Case in point: the thin layer of oil that is applied to bowling lanes, which Hooper found can vary widely in volume and shape among different venues, plus the lack of uniformity in applying the layer, which creates an uneven friction surface.\n\nPer the authors, most research to date has relied on statistically analyzing empirical data, such as a 2018 report by the US Bowling Congress that looked at data generated by 37 bowlers. (Hooper relied on ball-tracking data for his 2017 Weber Cup analysis.) A 2009 analysis showed that the optimal location for the ball to strike the headpin is about 6 centimeters off-center, while the optimal entry angle for the ball to hit is about 6 degrees. However, such an approach struggles to account for the inevitable player variability. No bowler hits their target 100 percent of the time, and per Hooper et al., while the best professionals can come within 0.1 degrees from the optimal launch angle, this slight variation can nonetheless result in a difference of several centimeters down-lane.", "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bowling2-1152x648-1744384355.jpg", "images": ["https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/themes/ars-v9/public/images/firework-loader.75ab30.gif", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bowling1-640x590.jpg", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bowling2-640x442.jpg", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bowling2-1152x648-1744384355.jpg", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1832935833-768x432.jpg", "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/arspic300.jpg"], "authors": []}, {"title": "4chan has been down since Monday night after \u201cpretty comprehensive own\u201d", "url": "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/internet-cesspit-4chan-apparently-hacked-mostly-unreachable-since-monday-night/", "source": "Ars Technica", "category": "technology", "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 18:43:29 +0000", "summary": "Early info is unreliable, but the site has been mostly unavailable for hours.", "full_content": "", "text": "Infamous Internet imageboard and wretched hive of scum and villainy 4chan was apparently hacked at some point Monday evening and remains mostly unreachable as of this writing.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nScullin and his co-author Jared Benge, a neuropsychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, gathered large studies that tracked cognitive and other health outcomes\u2014and that also included information on participants\u2019 everyday technology use. The authors identified 57 studies and rated them for the quality of their evidence, based on sample size, methods, and more. In analyzing the studies\u2019 results, the researchers found technology use pointed to a reduced risk of cognitive decline. This outcome could not be solely explained by demographic, socioeconomic, health or other lifestyle factors in isolation.\n\nA possibility that using digital technology could potentially help stave off cognitive decline aligns with the cognitive reserve theory, or the idea that the brain can work around damage from neurodegenerative diseases by finding alternate ways to complete tasks. This theory, based on a 1988 study in which individuals with no dementia symptoms were found to have Alzheimer\u2019s-like changes in their brain, holds that engaging with complex mental activities may lead to better cognitive well-being in older age.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that the reverse is true: instead of technology use staving off dementia, early experiences of cognitive decline could decrease older adults\u2019 likelihood of engaging with technology in the first place. Or an unknown third variable could be affecting both technology use and cognitive decline. \u201cCorrelation is not causation,\u201d Benge stresses.\n\n\u201cI was not especially surprised by the results, but I was surprised by how clear and consistent they were,\u201d says neuroscientist Sam Gilbert of University College London, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study. \u201cThis study provides a robust challenge to the pervasive fears about \u2018digital dementia\u2019 and highlights the potential of technology as a tool for cognitive enrichment,\u201d says Chiara Scarampi, a neuroscientist at the University of Geneva, who also was not involved with the study.\n\n\u201c\u2018Digital dementia\u2019 has always felt like a catchy but overstated concept to me,\u201d she adds. \u201cCognitive offloading\u2014using tools like reminders or GPS\u2014is not inherently harmful.

The aircraft is smeared in the image because it was in motion, while the farm fields below appear as crisp as any other view on Google Earth.\n\nThere's something else that now appears on Google Earth.

The identity of the satellite hasn't been confirmed, but its appearance is similar to that of a SpaceX Starlink satellite, specifically a Starlink V2 Mini, with two solar panels spanning some 100 feet (30 meters) end to end. There are more than 7,000 Starlink satellites in space today, more than all other satellite constellations combined, so it wouldn't be surprising that the first Google Earth capture of another spacecraft in orbit would show a Starlink.\n\nGoogle Earth data indicates that the image was taken on November 30, 2024, by a high-resolution Pleiades observation satellite owned by Airbus.

The regular RTX 5060 will follow at some point in May for the same $299 MSRP as the last-generation RTX 4060.

Both models include modest increases in the number of CUDA cores compared to the last-generation 4060 and 4060 Ti models, with the same amount of RAM and the same 128-bit memory interface. But an upgrade to GDDR7 instead of GDDR6 provides a healthy bump to memory bandwidth and is probably also partially responsible for an increase in peak power consumption.

They have sought to paint offshore wind as a whale killer that snarls shipping lanes and hamstrings national security.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\n\nThe 68-page investigation, which comes amid President Donald Trump's pledge to shut down the industry, paints a different picture.\n\nIt makes a nod to concerns of fishermen that their input is received too late in the federal permitting process, recommending that regulators take additional steps to demonstrate how they incorporate fishermen\u2019s feedback into their decisions. And it reprises federal research on turbine\u2019s impact to marine radar \u2014 noting how wind development can impair navigation and efforts to address the issue.\n\nBut it also reflects the scientific consensus that wind poses limited risks to whales, contrary to the popular GOP talking point.\n\n\"Wind development could bring jobs and investment to communities. At the same time, it could disrupt commercial fishing to varying degrees,\" GAO wrote. \"Turbines could also affect radar system performance, alter search and rescue methods, and alter historic and cultural landscapes.\"\n\nThe result is a series of modest reforms needed to fill gaps in the government's oversight of offshore wind, such as opening an office in the Northeast to help the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement better oversee the industry and address local concerns. Both bureaus are divisions of the Interior Department charged with overseeing offshore wind development.\n\nNotably, much of the report is dedicated to a topic that Republicans did not ask GAO to investigate: coordination with Native American tribes. GAO called BOEM's engagement with tribes \"inconsistent,\" writing that the bureau \"has not consistently engaged in meaningful consultation with Tribes during the offshore wind energy development process as called for in directives and guidance for tribal consultation.\"\n\nWind opponents and advocates alike said GAO's findings validated their long held positions. The report confirmed that issues raised by offshore wind opponents \u201cweren\u2019t just hypothetical concerns, they were real and serious,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican who was among the lawmakers to request the study.\n\nHillary Bright, president of the pro-wind group Turn Forward, said the findings showed \u201coffshore wind development should move forward with robust community engagement and strong environmental protections.\u201d\n\nThe comments reflect the high stakes of the moment. Trump signed an executive order on his first day back in the White House ordering federal agencies to halt permits for new offshore wind projects and directing them to review existing ones.\n\nFive projects already had entered varying degrees of construction when Trump came into office and have continued to move ahead. In recent weeks, wind opponents have ratcheted up calls for the president to stop them.\n\nRep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, wrote to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum last month warning that the department needed to stop Equinor from embarking on offshore construction of its Empire Wind project off New York. When the Norwegian company moved ahead with the initial phases of construction, it prompted the leader of a Long Island commercial fishing group to pen an op-ed in the New York Post last week warning of a \u201cman-made disaster.\u201d\n\nThe conservative activist Steven Milloy wrote in the Daily Caller that the Interior Department needed to follow through on Trump\u2019s pledge to halt offshore wind development completely.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on saving the whales and the rest of us from offshore wind and followed up with an Executive order,\u201d Milloy wrote.\n\n\u201cSomeone,\u201d he concluded, \u201chas got to see to their execution.\u201d\n\nThe GAO report notes that offshore wind poses limited risk to whales, addressing a series of longstanding arguments raised by wind opponents. The radar used by offshore wind developers to probe the ocean floor to identify turbine locations is less powerful than those employed by the oil and gas industry.\n\nWhales and other marine wildlife are also likely to vacate an area when developers begin pile driving foundations into the seabed. And noise generated by the turbines once they enter operation is likely indistinguishable to wildlife from other sounds in the ocean, GAO said.\n\nBut it also provided fodder for offshore wind opponents who seized on the report\u2019s finding that turbines reduce the effectiveness of marine radar in military and marine applications. Smith, the New Jersey congressman, said it provided the \u201cscientific justification\u201d for Trump\u2019s wind pause.\n\nThe GAO\u2019s findings aren\u2019t new. They were based in part on a pair of reports conducted during the Biden administration, including a 2024 study by the Energy Department and a 2022 study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. And GAO also noted the steps that agencies have taken to reduce the risks posed by wind farms. The Defense Department, for instance, has developed processes like exclusion areas and has agreements with wind developers to curtail production if needed, GAO noted.\n\nGAO interviewed 23 people with expertise in fisheries, marine wildlife, oceanography, marine transportation and radar, among others. One expert told GAO that large shipping vessels could have difficulty avoiding turbines in the event of a mechanical failure and that smaller ships emerging from a wind farm might not be visible to larger ships radar.\n\nThe report also noted that offshore wind could have negative impacts on commercial fishermen, who have long argued that their input is considered too late in the process to have a meaningful impact on a project\u2019s design and location.\n\nThe federal government engages in a lengthy permitting process, first accepting public comment on areas it is considering for wind development, then again when an area is leased for wind development and once again when a project submits its proposed design.\n\n\u201cStakeholders remain concerned that BOEM has not adequately considered or addressed the concerns of the commercial fishing industry,\u201d GAO wrote, adding, \u201cit is not clear how BOEM ensures that these stakeholders are consistently included in the process and informed of BOEM\u2019s efforts to incorporate input from the industry when establishing lease areas.\u201d\n\nThe Interior Department and BOEM did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut in a letter to GAO, BOEM Deputy Director Walter Cruickshank said it concurred with GAO\u2019s recommendations, though he said the watchdog\u2019s proposal for a new office in the Northeast would depend on whether offshore wind development aligns with the Trump administration\u2019s priorities.\n\nReprinted from E&E News with permission from POLITICO, LLC.

Work on the site had barely started before Congress ended the project\u2019s funding altogether in 2011.\n\nThe 94 nuclear reactors currently operating at 54 power plants continue to generate more radioactive waste. Public and commercial interest in nuclear power is rising because of concerns regarding emissions from fossil fuel power plants and the possibility of new applications for smaller-scale nuclear plants to power data centers and manufacturing. This renewed interest gives new urgency to the effort to find a place to put the waste.\n\nIn March 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments related to the effort to find a temporary storage location for the nation\u2019s nuclear waste \u2013 a ruling is expected by late June. No matter the outcome, the decades-long struggle to find a permanent place to dispose of nuclear waste will probably continue for many years to come.\n\nI am a scholar who specializes in corrosion; one focus of my work has been containing nuclear waste during temporary storage and permanent disposal. There are generally two forms of significantly radioactive waste in the U.S.: waste from making nuclear weapons during the Cold War, and waste from generating electricity at nuclear power plants. There are also small amounts of other radioactive waste, such as that associated with medical treatments.\n\nWaste from weapons manufacturing\n\nRemnants of the chemical processing of radioactive material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, often called \u201cdefense waste,\u201d will eventually be melted along with glass, with the resulting material poured into stainless steel containers. These canisters are 10 feet tall and 2 feet in diameter, weighing approximately 5,000 pounds when filled.\n\nFor now, though, most of it is stored in underground steel tanks, primarily at Hanford, Washington, and Savannah River, South Carolina, key sites in U.S. nuclear weapons development. At Savannah River, some of the waste has already been processed with glass, but much of it remains untreated.\n\nAt both of those locations, some of the radioactive waste has already leaked into the soilbeneath the tanks, though officials have said there is no danger to human health. Most of the current efforts to contain the waste focus on protecting the tanks from corrosion and cracking to prevent further leakage.\n\nWaste from electricity generation\n\nThe vast majority of nuclear waste in the U.S. is spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear power plants.\n\nBefore it is used, nuclear fuel exists as uranium oxide pellets that are sealed within zirconium tubes, which are themselves bundled together. These bundles of fuel rods are about 12 to 16 feet long and about 5 to 8 inches in diameter. In a nuclear reactor, the fission reactions fueled by the uranium in those rods emit heat that is used to create hot water or steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.\n\nAfter about three to five years, the fission reactions in a given bundle of fuel slow down significantly, even though the material remains highly radioactive. The spent fuel bundles are removed from the reactor and moved elsewhere on the power plant\u2019s property, where they are placed into a massive pool of water to cool them down.\n\nAfter about five years, the fuel bundles are removed, dried and sealed in welded stainless steel canisters. These canisters are still radioactive and thermally hot, so they are stored outdoors in concrete vaults that sit on concrete pads, also on the power plant\u2019s property. These vaults have vents to ensure air flows past the canisters to continue cooling them.\n\nAs of December 2024, there were over 315,000 bundles of spent nuclear fuel rods in the U.S., and over 3,800 dry storage casks in concrete vaults above ground, located at current and former power plants across the country.\n\nEven reactors that have been decommissioned and demolished still have concrete vaults storing radioactive waste, which must be secured and maintained by the power company that owned the nuclear plant.\n\nSalt spray from the ocean can corrode waste containers at nearby nuclear waste storage sites, like this one at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in California. Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nThe threat of water\n\nOne threat to these storage methods is corrosion.\n\nBecause they need water to both transfer nuclear energy into electricity and to cool the reactor, nuclear power plants are always located alongside sources of water.\n\nIn the U.S., nine are within two miles of the ocean, which poses a particular threat to the waste containers. As waves break on the coastline, saltwater is sprayed into the air as particles. When those salt and water particles settle on metal surfaces, they can cause corrosion, which is why it\u2019s common to see heavily corroded structures near the ocean.\n\nAt nuclear waste storage locations near the ocean, that salt spray can settle on the steel canisters. Generally, stainless steel is resistant to corrosion, which you can see in the shiny pots and pans in many Americans\u2019 kitchens. But in certain circumstances, localized pits and cracks can form on stainless steel surfaces.\n\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Energy has funded research, including my own, into the potential dangers of this type of corrosion. The general findings are that stainless steel canisters could pit or crack when stored near a seashore. But a radioactive leak would require not only corrosion of the container but also of the zirconium rods and of the fuel inside them. So it is unlikely that this type of corrosion would result in the release of radioactivity.\n\nA long way off\n\nA more permanent solution is likely years, or decades, away.\n\nNot only must a long-term site be geologically suitable to store nuclear waste for thousands of years, but it must also be politically palatable to the American people. In addition, there will be many challenges associated with transporting the waste, in its containers, by road or rail, from reactors across the country to wherever that permanent site ultimately is.\n\nPerhaps there will be a temporary site whose location passes muster with the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the waste will stay where it is.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

Science, he thinks, has acquired a reputation for being dense and dull, but to him it\u2019s \u201cthe greatest story ever told.\u201d As a graphics journalist, Belan aims to translate that wonder into eye-catching visuals that inspire people to appreciate sea slugs and ant colonies and other overlooked natural phenomena.\n\nFor this issue\u2019s Graphic Science, written by Scientific American senior editor Clara Moskowitz, Belan charted the lifespans of some of Earth\u2019s most incredible creatures, from fleeting worms to 15,000-year-old sea sponges. His graphic, which has a playful, toylike quality, invites readers into a 3D space alongside the data.\n\n\u201cLooking at the diversity of lifespans across species on our planet really tickles the brain,\u201d encouraging people to wonder how it all evolved, Belan says. This project reminded him of his master\u2019s degree studies in geochemistry and astrobiology; he examined the biological footprints life leaves behind to potentially seek them elsewhere in the universe. \u201cChemistry and physics exist beyond Earth, right?

First, \u201cit rarely happens that the industry at the center of controversy says [to a journalist], \u2018Come and have a look,\u2019\u201d he says. Yet that\u2019s precisely what happened: Marx visited the MV Coco off the coast of Papua New Guinea to observe some of the first commercial deep-sea mining operations. Second, when Marx asked residents for their perspectives on the mining, it turned out they were learning about it for the first time\u2014which made Marx\u2019s role part of the story. This was \u201ca bit unnerving\u201d for a journalist accustomed to being a mere observer, he says.\n\nMarx travels often for assignments\u2014when we spoke over the phone for this interview, he was reporting in Rome on the pope\u2019s health. His time onboard the Coco was far from his first work trip at sea; in fact, he\u2019d visited the very same ship while writing about the recovery mission for the Titan submersible, which imploded on its way to visit the Titanic wreckage.\n\nThis stint on the Coco came with an unusual requirement: a three-day safety course that involved plunging upside down into a pool in a mock helicopter, then breaking the helicopter window to swim out. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty intense requirement for a story outside of a combat zone, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\n\nHannah Nordhaus\n\nA New Threat to Honeybees\n\nIn 2006 worker bees in hives across the U.S. began disappearing. The causes of this devastating phenomenon, called colony collapse disorder, remain largely a mystery, says journalist Hannah Nordhaus, who covered this event in her 2011 book, The Beekeeper\u2019s Lament (Harper Perennial). But the epidemic probably had something to do with varroa mites\u2014tiny parasites the industry had been battling for years. As Nordhaus writes in her feature for this issue, there will soon be a new, more deadly mite in town. Tropilaelaps, or tropi, mites \u201cadd another element of precarity\u201d to the already risky beekeeping industry on which so many crops depend, she explains. Like this story, \u201call my bee stories have started with people,\u201d Nordhaus says. This article begins with Sammy Ramsey of the University of Colorado Boulder, who is sounding the alarm on tropi mites.\n\nNordhaus, who lives in Boulder, was raised in Washington, D.C., in a family involved in politics and environmentalism. Her roots, though, are farther west. Her second book, American Ghost (HarperCollins, 2015), tells the story of her great-great-grandmother, whose ghost was said to haunt a hotel in Santa Fe, N.M. As soon as Nordhaus had the opportunity, she moved out west, where her passions for history and the environment are both engaged. \u201cIn any history of the American West, there\u2019s always an environmental strand that weaves through it.\u201d", "image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7c13ae68bd3623a9/original/sa0525Cont01a.jpg?m=1743615781.874&w=1200", "images": ["https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7c13ae68bd3623a9/original/sa0525Cont01a.jpg?m=1743615781.874&w=600", "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/57a8a02acaee5331/original/sa0525Cvr.jpg?m=1743170253.741", "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/7c13ae68bd3623a9/original/sa0525Cont01a.jpg?m=1743615781.874&w=1200"], "authors": ["Allison Parshall", "Jen Schwartz"]}, {"title": "Readers Respond to the January 2025 Issue", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/readers-respond-to-the-january-2025-issue/", "source": "Scientific American", "category": "science", "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "summary": "<p>Letters to the editors for the January 2025 issue of <i>Scientific American</i></p>", "full_content": "", "text": "HIDDEN PLANET\n\nAfter I read \u201cThe Hunt for Planet Nine,\u201d by Robin George Andrews, it occurred to me that one thing that should be discussed is the possibility of sending a probe out to this hidden planet in our solar system, should the new Vera C.

But after launch it might take decades for a spacecraft to reach that destination, so you\u2019d have to be incredibly patient.\n\nIn response to Philo: A small primordial black hole isn\u2019t impossible, but such objects remain theoretical, and as astronomer Mike Brown noted in my article, it\u2019s far more likely that Planet Nine is just a difficult-to-find planet. It might be one that\u2019s so dim that it doesn\u2019t reflect much light.\n\nRegarding Kirsch\u2019s question: I think a brown dwarf is simply too massive to explain the gravitational perturbances detected by astronomers.

There is certainly a case to be made that the vagus nerve plays a role\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014in the placebo response. The expectation of an effective treatment could conceivably activate vagal pathways that influence various parts of the body, including the heart and gut, which in turn communicate with the brain. Seen this way, the placebo effect is not \u201call in the head\u201d but instead involves deeper physiological mechanisms than previously understood.\n\nWith respect to vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for major depression, however, its effects on successfully treated patients appear to extend beyond placebo. Whereas the placebo responses tend to kick in quickly but are short-lived, VNS has been shown to induce gradual, cumulative improvements that persist over years of treatment. Moreover, neuroimaging studies for both VNS and transcutaneous VNS have shown changes in brain regions that didn\u2019t occur in sham treatments. Future research should deepen our understanding of how the vagus nerve contributes to placebo effects while driving lasting physiological changes.\n\nTILING SHAPES\n\nIn \u201cTessellation Revelation\u201d [December 2024], Elise Cutts discusses mathematician G\u00e1bor Domokos\u2019s work on tiling \u201csoft cell\u201d shapes in two and three dimensions. Is there research into tiling in dimensions greater than three?\n\nBRUCE BAKELY SAN DIEGO, CALIF.\n\nThe image of a 3D-printed soft cell derived from a hexagonal prism in Cutts\u2019s article bears a resemblance to the curvy lines of an ancient Egyptian artifact called the Sabu disk. Is that purely accidental?\n\nREINHOLD SCHLIEPER VIA E-MAIL\n\nCUTTS REPLIES: Bakely is not alone in pondering four-dimensional soft cells. \u201cWe are often getting this question,\u201d Domokos says. But he says his team hasn\u2019t set about answering it\u2014yet. Other projects have the researchers\u2019 attention for now.\n\nRegarding the Sabu disk: \u201cThis is stunning!\u201d Domokos says. Because there is only a single example of the artifact, it\u2019s hard to say for sure why it has the geometry it does. But Domokos thinks there might be a reason the disk looks like a soft cell. Let\u2019s say you had a closed area with sixfold symmetry (like a regular hexagon) and wanted to turn its 2D curve into a 3D curve. If you tried to preserve as much of the boundary\u2019s symmetry as possible while keeping curvature to a minimum, Domokos says, you would end up with something like the Sabu disk\u2019s perimeter\u2014and the boundary curve of the soft cell based on the hexagonal prism. Although it\u2019s a mystery what motivated the creators of the Sabu disk, \u201cI think we acted under similar constraints and got similar results,\u201d Domokos says. \u201cBeautiful!\u201d\n\nHUBBLE TENSION\n\n\u201cCosmic Confusion,\u201d by Marc Kamionkowski and Adam G. Riess [November 2024], explores whether a new form of dark energy can resolve the so-called Hubble tension, the disagreement among estimates of how fast the universe is expanding. Can it be ruled out that dark energy is a force field produced by another nearby universe or even another universe that encloses ours?\n\nJIM SULLIVAN VIA E-MAIL\n\nIs it possible that the universe is spinning? If so, how would it do so? And could that affect the different expansion rates that have been observed, as if we were a slice of pepperoni on a pizza observing the pizza expand around us as it was tossed into the air?\n\nCAMPBELL HODGSON VIA E-MAIL\n\nTHE AUTHORS REPLY: Sullivan\u2019s interesting question would require more work to define and understand before it could be answered. People have indeed floated ideas about models with extra spacetime dimensions. There may be other universes that could be \u201cnear\u201d our own in some of these extra spatial dimensions. We\u2019re not familiar with any work to implement these ideas in a solution to the Hubble tension, though.\n\nHodgson brings up an excellent question, but we think the answer is no. In a spinning body, the speed at which something moves is proportional to its distance from the center. As physicists, we would say the universe is so big that even if it were spinning extremely slowly, there would be some distance at which things would be moving faster than the speed of light, which is not allowed. And observations so far support that the universe is uniform in all directions, which would preclude spinning.\n\nCLARIFICATION\n\n\u201cThe Astronaut Club,\u201d by Clara Moskowitz and Zane Wolf [Graphic Science; February], noted that Oliver Daemen became the youngest person in space at age 18 in 2021.

From sea to sky, the Carolinas have been grappling with disaster.\n\nAll the while, people make lists of places in the U.S. that are supposedly more resistant to climate change.

Winter freezes are crippling the power grid in Texas and other southern regions. Migration is not a quick fix for the climate crisis, and it certainly isn\u2019t the most equitable. We must recognize that in addition to curbing our fossil-fuel use, adequately fortifying and restructuring the spaces we already have will give us and the next generations the best possible chance of survival.\n\nHow every level of government chooses to respond to this crisis will matter.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need governance at all levels to accept not only that climate change is real but that it is something we must both adapt to and mitigate. These two ideas are not mutually exclusive\u2014choosing adaptation, or changing our local environments to make them more resilient to climate change, doesn\u2019t mean we no longer try to slow that change.\n\nPerhaps on top of its favorable location and weather, Asheville was considered a climate haven because its local government has accepted the reality of climate change. Before the floods came, the city had approved its Municipal Climate Action Plan, setting goals for renewable energy, more sustainable infrastructure and reduced waste production in the city. The plan states that one of its goals is an increase in renewable energy generation, including the use of solar panels to power city-owned properties and adherence to sustainable practices for new construction and retrofits. But with the loss of tree cover and the demands of a growing population making Asheville more vulnerable to landslides, the city will have to continue to adjust\u2014as will the state, which has its own climate resiliency plan.\n\nBut will North Carolina be able to use disaster relief to push through a sustainable recovery under threat from the politicization of climate change? The state\u2019s resiliency office is underfunded even though the new governor, Josh Stein, campaigned in part on building a state better able to withstand the effects of climate change. It\u2019s not immediately clear how his slew of disaster-related executive orders about temporary housing and rebuilding roads and bridges will factor into adaptation efforts.\n\nWhat is clear is that the idea that people will be able to up and move to some cities or states that seem more able to withstand our climate crisis is profoundly unjust. The median home price in Washtenaw County, Michigan, where Ann Arbor is located, is about $380,000. That makes it the second-most expensive county in the state. Other Michigan counties are significantly cheaper, but few are prepared, or even preparing, for permanent population increases. Winter is getting shorter along the Great Lakes, and not only is flooding becoming more of an issue, but the weather is getting hotter. Even housing prices in Buffalo are increasing.\n\nThe bottom line is that historically mild weather, historically agreeable climates and historically responsive governments have made some places in the U.S. seemingly more resistant to the effects of climate change. But the crisis knows no boundaries\u2014Canadian wildfires blew smoke into New York City last summer and blanketed Buffalo the year before. Even adaptation won\u2019t completely solve the problem.\n\nIn the end, how every level of government chooses to respond to this crisis will matter. Individual cities can\u2019t manage this problem alone, and neither can states. How will cities such as Austin, Tex., make meaningful adaptations in one of the U.S. states most susceptible to global warming if its governor and legislature largely downplay climate concerns and actively thwart efforts to reduce fossil-fuel use? Texas\u2019s water supply is in dire straits, and far too many people there and in places such as Arizona will be left behind in this great migration north.\n\nAnd how will we fare as a nation under an administration that denies climate change is real? One that is actively rolling back environmental protections, throwing out environmental justice cases, and promoting the production of more and more fossil fuels?\n\nThe idea that any one place in any nation is more resistant or more resilient to forces that are global in nature is clever marketing and nothing else. The message might make people feel better by letting them believe they can just escape the climate crisis by moving to a different city, but this is a bill of goods. Our entire planet is in the throes of warming. Rather than trying to outrun it, we must demand leadership that will help fund our efforts to adapt, look to state and local leaders to make those adaptation plans reality, and continue to seek ways to change the very things that started this climate-haven conversation in the first place\u2014burning fossil fuels and abusing our forests, farmlands and good fortune.", "image": "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/938af0b533feed9/original/sa0525Agnd01.jpg?m=1743617306.943&w=1200", "images": ["https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/57a8a02acaee5331/original/sa0525Cvr.jpg?m=1743170253.741", "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/938af0b533feed9/original/sa0525Agnd01.jpg?m=1743617306.943&w=600", "https://static.scientificamerican.com/dam/m/938af0b533feed9/original/sa0525Agnd01.jpg?m=1743617306.943&w=1200"], "authors": ["The Editors"]}, {"title": "Why Some Animals Live for Only Days and Others Live for Thousands of Years", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-some-animals-live-for-only-days-and-others-live-for-thousands-of-years/", "source": "Scientific American", "category": "science", "published": "Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:00:00 +0000", "summary": "<p>Scientists are studying why some species live so much longer than others</p>", "full_content": "", "text": "Scientists are studying why some species live so much longer than others\n\nWhy Some Animals Live for Only Days and Others Live for Thousands of Years\n\nI agree my information will be processed in accordance with the Scientific American and Springer Nature Limited Privacy Policy\n\nSome species seem to live fast and die young. Others, though, \u201cappear not to age,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Pedro de Magalh\u00e3es, a molecular biologist at the University of Birmingham in England. He is project leader of the Human Ageing Genomic Resources program, which keeps the AnAge database of maximum animal lifespans. Some species of turtles, fishes and salamanders, for instance, don\u2019t show any signs of degeneration or senescence as they grow older. If they didn\u2019t die of predation, accidents or infectious disease, they could live extremely long lives, Magalh\u00e3es says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a biological mystery why some species age faster than others,\u201d Magalh\u00e3es says. \u201cWe still don\u2019t understand well the mechanisms behind aging.\u201d Species that face high predation usually evolve to grow quickly and reach sexual maturity rapidly. Other creatures that don\u2019t face pressure to reproduce early can age slowly: Greenland sharks, for instance (the top of their food chain), may take 150 years to reach sexual maturity.\n\nDNA mutations are thought to play a role in determining lifespans, with longer-lived species tending to evolve better DNA-repair systems to help ward off cancer. Short-lived creatures, such as mice, don\u2019t have these abilities, because in the wild they often die of predation before cancer becomes an issue. Laboratory-raised mice, however, have very high rates of cancer.\n\nOn supporting science journalism\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

You can just write a prompt into Copilot or ChatGPT or similar tools, and it will likely write you a basic webpage, or a small application, a game in Python,\" Dohmke said. \"And so, AI makes software development so much more accessible for anyone who wants to learn coding.\" \n\nAI, Dohmke said, helps to \"realize the dream\" of bringing an idea to life, meaning that fewer projects will end up dead in the water, and smaller teams of developers will be enabled to tackle larger-scale projects.

That happened today, as spotted by MacRumors, with two noteworthy \"vintage\" additions: iPhone 6s and Mac mini (2018). The latter product is especially significant, because the 2018 Mac mini was the last remaining Intel model that was not yet labeled either vintage or obsolete.\n \nSo what are those timelines exactly?

The letter tells Lovable to stop using the term \"Dev Mode\" for a new product feature. Figma, which also has a feature called Dev Mode, successfully trademarked that term last year, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark office. What's wild is that \"dev mode\" is a common term used in many products that cater to software programmers. It's like an edit mode. Software products from giant companies like Apple's iOS, Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Xbox have features formally called \"developer mode\" that then get nicknamed \"dev mode\" in reference materials.\n \nEven \"dev mode\" itself is commonly used. For instance Atlassian used it in products that pre-date Figma's copyright by years. And it's a common feature name in countless open source software projects. Figma tells TechCrunch that its trademark refers only to the shortcut \"Dev Mode\" -- not the full term \"developer mode.\" Still, it's a bit like trademarking the term \"bug\" to refer to \"debugging.\" Since Figma wants to own the term, it has little choice but send cease-and-desist letters. (The letter, as many on X pointed out, was very polite, too.) If Figma doesn't defend the term, it could be absorbed as a generic term and the trademarked becomes unenforceable.<p><div class=\"share_submission\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Figma+Sent+a+Cease-and-Desist+Letter+To+Lovable+Over+the+Term+'Dev+Mode'%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F15%2F203233%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyro.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F04%2F15%2F203233%2Ffigma-sent-a-cease-and-desist-letter-to-lovable-over-the-term-dev-mode%3Futm_source%3Dslashdot%26utm_medium%3Dfacebook\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/facebook_icon_large.png\" /></a>\n\n\n\n</div></p><p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/story/25/04/15/203233/figma-sent-a-cease-and-desist-letter-to-lovable-over-the-term-dev-mode?utm_source=rss1.0moreanon&amp;utm_medium=feed\">Read more of this story</a> at Slashdot.</p>", "full_content": "", "text": "One has to look out for engineers -- they begin with sewing machines and end up with the atomic bomb. -- Marcel Pagnol", "image": "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/programming_64.png", "images": ["https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/mac_64.png", "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/ccpa-optout.png", "https://slashdot.org/images/njs.gif?251", "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/programming_64.png", "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/court_64.png", "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/ai_64.png"], "authors": []}]}
