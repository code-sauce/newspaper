J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nRising pressure\n\nThe expected meeting, which McCarthy\u2019s office announced earlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.\n\nWashington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communication amid flaring tensions over issues from a downed suspected Chinese surveillance balloon to semiconductor supply chains \u2013 raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.\n\nTaiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan\u2019s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai\u2019s presidential office.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan 03:05 - Source: CNN See image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan 03:05\n\nBut a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.\n\nFor Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, \u201cit\u2019s clearly a capstone event,\u201d according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University\u2019s Taiwan Studies Program. \u201cShe has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who \u2026 has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,\u201d he said.\n\nThat increased visibility \u2013 and enhanced cooperation with the US \u2013 has followed China\u2019s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.\n\nChina\u2019s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.\n\nThe party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping \u2013 and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.\n\nThat\u2019s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China\u2019s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of \u201creunification.\u201d\n\nIt is those pressures \u2013 and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing \u2013 that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.\n\nCongress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years. Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.\n\nWhile the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.\n\nUnder Washington\u2019s longstanding \u201cOne China\u201d policy, the US acknowledges China\u2019s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing\u2019s claim to the island of 23 million.\n\nThough McCarthy does not have Pelosi\u2019s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.\n\nLast month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future \u2013 something he had earlier said he wanted to do.\n\nFighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency. Gong Yulong/Xinhua/AP\n\nBeijing watching\n\nA meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.\n\nPelosi\u2019s trip \u2013 the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years \u2013 generated a fever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoric in mainland China.\n\nThis time, so far, domestic conversation in China\u2019s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.\n\nBut the stakes remain high \u2013 including for Beijing itself \u2013 over how it responds, analysts say.\n\nAs Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan\u2019s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.\n\nIt could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT member Ma Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.\n\nMa\u2019s tour is a \u201conce in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn\u2019t want to tank that,\u201d said Sung, the political scientist.\n\nChina is also acutely aware that its actions toward Taiwan are under a significantly brighter global spotlight following the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi. Putin\u2019s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.\n\nBeijing has recently sought to position itself as an agent of peace in that conflict \u2013 especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.\n\nThis week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China \u2013 an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.\n\nAn aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during a face-to-face meeting in Bali.\n\n\u201c(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.\n\n\u201cA reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.\u201d", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230403194210-01-us-china-taiwan-tension.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill"}, {"title": "Video shows moment of deadly explosion at cafe in Russia", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2023/04/02/russian-military-blogger-vladlen-tatarsky-killed-cafe-explosion-chance-vpx.cnn", "source": "CNN", "published": "Tue, 04 Apr 2023 01:08:44 GMT", "summary": "A well-known Russian military blogger, Vladlen Tatarsky, was killed in an explosion at a cafe in St. Petersburg, authorities said.

It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it \u201cwas capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.\u201d\n\nGen.

The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nDonald Trump will take America through yet another grave and unprecedented national drama this week when he becomes the first ex-president to appear in court charged with a crime.\n\nThe 45th president is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday in Manhattan, the stage where he built his legend as a brash popular culture figure and real estate magnate but which could now, in the case of \u201cThe People of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump,\u201d engineer his downfall.\n\nIn what will be extraordinary scenes, Trump will return to New York after a grand jury voted to indict him last week in a case involving a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. His appearance, accompanied by Secret Service agents, will come as he fires up his 2024 campaign for the White House. Trump plans to make a make a speech when he gets back to Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night in which he will seek to leverage political advantage out of a perilous, personal legal crisis.\n\nFor many Americans who disdain Trump and his riotous single term, the case could be a sign that, finally, he is being called to account for his rule-crushing behavior and that everyone \u2013 even former presidents \u2013 are equal under the law. But Trump, using his bond with his most loyal supporters, is claiming the prosecution is a case of naked political persecution from District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, that\u2019s designed to thwart the possibility of a presidential comeback. According to fundraising numbers that his campaign is touting, Trump is getting a political boost from the attention.\n\nYet a criminal indictment takes Trump into unique political territory. And however the case turns out, his return to the spotlight in these circumstances is another twist in an exhausting saga featuring a double impeachment, false claims of a stolen election, and a mob attack on the US Congress during an unruly four-year presidency that pushed the nation to the point of exhaustion and deepened its polarization.\n\nSome legal experts, without having seen the still-sealed indictment, have questioned whether a case that appears to revolve around infringements of accounting practices and possible campaign finance violations is sufficiently serious to merit the historical step of indicting an ex-president who is already running again.\n\nAt the same time, it is ultimately Trump\u2019s norm-busting behavior that pushed the country to this somber moment. He\u2019s also being investigated over efforts to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia, and by a special counsel probing his hoarding of classified documents and conduct in the run up to January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. In several of these cases, Trump could face even more serious legal problems than in the Stormy Daniels matter, but that case is the only one so far that has yielded an indictment.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in all of the cases. But once more, America\u2019s political and legal systems, under a near-constant stress test since he came down the escalator in Trump Tower to launch his campaign in 2015, will be put under enormous pressure that is likely to only deepen the country\u2019s internal estrangement.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230331140346-donald-trump-230304.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill"}]}
